Ahur ðŸ˜¢ ðŸ‡µðŸ‡° When not being spice, the father turned a knife on the daughter's throat and a heartbreaking event.  But Pakistan is developing the largest flags of millions of rupees. Does the flag make a difference in celebrating freedom or is it an honor to grow the flag  But one thing is, when a daughter asks her father for a college fee, the father does not have the money to pay the fee, then such incidents will happen   May God take care of the neighbors around you and the worthy neighborhood because in the rulers there is no shame that they also give some relief to the people.
